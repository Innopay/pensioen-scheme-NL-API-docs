      summary: Retrieve access token
      description: Access to resource endpoints is granted based on access tokens. Each approved and active Scheme participant must be able to request access tokens by using the token endpoint offered by each datasource. To obtain an Access Token the OAuth client credentials type grant flow is used as explained in RFC6749 & RFC7523, parameter naming conventions will follow OAuth standards. As clients may not be pre-registered, the client secret is replaced with a client assertion using the client's certificate. Additionally, the client presents a status token (issued & signed by Scheme Authority) to prove the accepted & active participant status for the client.
